I need help creating a comprehensive test case generator function for the following algorithm problem:

You need to take into consideration the efficiency of the running code as well.
<problem_statement>problem_temp.txt</problem_statement>

The test case generator should:
1. Include basic hand-crafted test cases covering:
   - Common/simple cases
   - Edge cases (empty, single element, etc.)
   - Corner cases specific to problem constraints
   - Known tricky scenarios

2. Generate random test cases that:
   - Cover the full range of input constraints
   - Have proper verification to ensure expected outputs
   - Include both valid and invalid cases
   - Have good distribution across different scenarios
   - Avoid accidental valid cases when generating invalid ones

3. Return test cases in format:
   [(input_params, expected_output), ...]

Here's my current (gold) implementation of the main algorithm, this should pass all testcases:
<gold_file>gold.py</gold_file>

Please help complete the test_cases generator, use <runner_file>runner_example.py</runner_file> to take inspiration on how to structure your final code.
Write your final testing script to the <runner_file>runner_example.py</runner_file>. Keep it simple.
